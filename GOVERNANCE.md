# Advanced Wallets Governance Model

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the governance model for the BitGo Advanced Wallets open source project. It outlines the roles, rules for participation, and decision-making processes to ensure the project remains secure and transparent.

## 2. Project Goals and Values

The decision to open source this project is driven by several key objectives, all rooted in transparency, security, and community benefit.

- **Security and Audits**: The primary goal is to enable the community to perform security audits. Open-sourcing all components provides full transparency and an auditable history of the codebase, which is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring a high level of security.

- **On-Premise Adoption**: We aim to promote the adoption of on-premise hot wallet setups. This project serves as a toolkit and example for users and services to integrate their own Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or Key Management Systems (KMSs) for user and backup key management.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

### Contributors

Any individual or organization can become a contributor. Contributors can submit code, documentation, and other changes through pull requests. The ability to contribute is open to everyone, regardless of their affiliation.

### Maintainers

The maintainers are individuals designated to review and approve contributions. They are responsible for ensuring the quality, security, and integrity of the project's codebase. For this project, a Maintainer is a member of the core BitGo team.

## 4. Contribution and Review Process

- All contributions must be submitted via a pull request to the main repository.
- A contribution is considered ready for merging only after it has been reviewed and approved by **at least two designated Maintainers**.
- The Maintainers will review the contribution for correctness, security implications, code quality, and alignment with the project's goals.
- Contributors are expected to be responsive to feedback from Maintainers to ensure a smooth review process.

## 5. Decision Making

### Consensus-Based for Core Changes

For significant changes to the project's architecture, roadmap, or governance, Maintainers will work toward a consensus.

### Maintainer Discretion

For standard pull requests, the final decision to merge rests with the Maintainers. Their role is to uphold the security and quality standards of the project.

## 6. Communication

- **GitHub Issues**: All bugs, feature requests, and technical discussions should be held on the project's GitHub issues page to ensure transparency and a public record.

- **Pull Request Comments**: All feedback and discussions related to specific code changes should take place directly on the pull request.

- **Support**: For general support, reach out to [support@bitgo.com](mailto:support@bitgo.com).
